        Here we could return "next page object",
        following so called Fluent PageObject pattern
        but usually it might lead to confusion in such cases.
        For example, what if we fail to follow the link
        and this is "as expected", e.g. according to our
        "negative" test case conditions.
        Then it's logically to expect "same pageobject" not "next one"
        Now we have two potential state as a result of this method execution.
        And it's not clear what to return;)
        So better to return "void"/None in such cases.
        Usually Fluent PageObject makes sense only in cases
        with only 1 possible result state, for example:
        - returning self (we for sure stay on the same page)
        - returning "sub-page-object" i.e. object of component on the page
